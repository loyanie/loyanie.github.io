In December 2019, I attended the 3rd Black in AI (BAI) workshop co-located with 33rd Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019) conference at the Vancouver Convention Centre in Canada. This event marked my first international conference and my inaugural trip outside Tanzania, presenting a significant milestone in my career. My presentation, "Decision Support System for Farmers against Tuta Absoluta Effects on Tomato Plants," highlighted the application of AI in agriculture. The workshop provided a unique platform for me to engage with experts from renowned universities and industries, expanding my understanding of AI and its global impact. This life-changing experience was made possible thanks to the full funding by BAI, reflecting their commitment to promoting diversity in the AI field. The knowledge and connections gained from this event have been instrumental in shaping my path in AI research and development.
