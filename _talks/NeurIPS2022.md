In late 2022, I had the remarkable opportunity to attend and present at the 6th Black in AI (BAI) workshop, which took place alongside the 36th Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) Conference in New Orleans, Louisiana, thanks to the full funding provided by BAI. This organization, dedicated to increasing the representation of Black individuals in artificial intelligence, enabled me to share my research through a poster titled "Segmentation of Tuta absoluta’s Damage on Tomato Plants: A Computer Vision Approach." The conference, running from November 28th to December 9th, was a convergence of leading minds in AI and machine learning, offering a rich platform for presenting my work on utilizing computer vision to tackle agricultural pests, specifically Tuta absoluta, which severely affects tomato crops globally.

The experience was profoundly enriching, not just academically but also personally, as it provided a unique environment to engage with experts, receive feedback, and explore the latest in AI research and applications. The BAI workshop, in particular, stood out as a vibrant hub for researchers from diverse backgrounds to exchange ideas, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose. Beyond the workshop, NeurIPS offered a wide array of sessions that spanned the spectrum of neural information processing, from theoretical advancements to practical applications, all of which broadened my understanding and appreciation of the field. The insights gained and the connections made during this event have had a lasting impact on my approach to research and my commitment to contributing to the advancement of AI for the betterment of society.
