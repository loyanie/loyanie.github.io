Participating in the 44th Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG’20) conference, which took place online from August 17th to 19th, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, provided a unique platform to showcase my research on leveraging artificial intelligence in agriculture. My poster presentation, titled "A Deep Learning Approach for Determining Effects of Tuta absoluta in Tomato Plants," highlighted the innovative use of deep learning techniques to identify and assess the impact of the Tuta absoluta pest on tomato crops. This research not only demonstrates the potential of AI to revolutionize agricultural practices by enabling more effective pest management strategies but also aligns with the conference's theme of utilizing technology for societal good. The virtual format of MD4SG’20 allowed for an unprecedented level of global participation and collaboration, fostering a rich exchange of ideas and insights on the intersection of technology, design, and social impact, and underscoring the vital role of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex global challenges.
