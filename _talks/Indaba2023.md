In September 2023, I had the distinguished opportunity to participate in the Deep Learning Indaba (DLI2023) conference, an event celebrated for its contribution to the growth and ethical application of AI across Africa, held in Accra, Ghana. This conference, which took place from the 3rd to the 9th, served as a significant platform for me to showcase my research through both a poster and a spotlight talk titled "Segmentation of Tuta absoluta’s Damage on Tomato Plants: A Computer Vision Approach." My work, focusing on utilizing advanced computer vision techniques to detect and assess the impact of the Tuta absoluta pest on tomato crops, was recognized with an honorable mention at the Weakly Supervised Computer Vision workshop. This accolade underscored the relevance and potential of applying AI solutions to critical agricultural challenges. The full funding of my attendance by DLI not only facilitated my participation but also emphasized the conference's commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive AI research community.

DLI2023 was an enriching experience that went beyond mere academic presentations; it was a gathering that celebrated African innovation in AI, bringing together a diverse group of individuals passionate about the potential of deep learning and machine learning technologies. The conference provided an invaluable platform for exchanging ideas, fostering collaborations, and discussing the future implications of AI in solving real-world problems, particularly in the agricultural sector. The interactions and feedback received during my presentations were incredibly beneficial, offering insights that could further refine and enhance my research. Being part of DLI2023 not only advanced my academic pursuits but also reinforced my dedication to contributing meaningfully to the AI community, inspired by the energy, innovation, and collective vision of the participants I engaged with throughout the conference.
