The invasion of the tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta) poses a significant threat to tomato productivity, leading to
substantial yield losses for farmers. Currently, there is a lack of reliable methods for quantifying the effects of
Tuta absoluta at an early stage before it causes significant damage. This research proposes a deep Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model for the segmentation-based quantification of Tuta absoluta on tomato plants. The
proposed quantification method employed a Mask RCNN model that achieved a mAP of 85.67 % and precisely
detected and segmented the shapes of Tuta absoluta-infected areas on tomato leaves. The ability to accurately
detect, segment and count Tuta mines in a tomato leaf image can have a significant impact on the agricultural
industry by enabling farmers to quickly assess the extent of damage to their crops and take appropriate measures
to prevent further losses.'
