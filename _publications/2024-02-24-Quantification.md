With the advances in technology, computer vision applications using deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been extensively applied in agriculture. Deploying these CNN models on mobile phones is beneficial in making them accessible to everyone, especially farmers and agricultural extension officers. This paper aims to automate the detection of damages caused by a devastating tomato pest known as Tuta Absoluta. To accomplish this objective, a CNN segmentation model trained on a tomato leaf image dataset is deployed on a smartphone application for early and real-time diagnosis of the pest and effective management at early tomato growth stages. The application can precisely detect and segment the shapes of Tuta Absoluta-infected areas on tomato leaves with a minimum confidence of 70% in 5 seconds only.'

The invasion of the tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta) poses a significant threat to tomato productivity, leading to
substantial yield losses for farmers. Currently, there is a lack of reliable methods for quantifying the effects of
Tuta absoluta at an early stage before it causes significant damage. This research proposes a deep Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model for the segmentation-based quantification of Tuta absoluta on tomato plants. The
proposed quantification method employed a Mask RCNN model that achieved a mAP of 85.67 % and precisely
detected and segmented the shapes of Tuta absoluta-infected areas on tomato leaves. The ability to accurately
detect, segment and count Tuta mines in a tomato leaf image can have a significant impact on the agricultural
industry by enabling farmers to quickly assess the extent of damage to their crops and take appropriate measures
to prevent further losses.
