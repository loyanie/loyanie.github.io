excerpt: 'In this study, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach in determining the effects of Tuta absoluta in tomato plants. Four CNN pre-trained architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet and Inception-V3) were used in training classifiers on a dataset containing health and infested tomato leaves collected from real field experiments. Among the pre-trained architectures, experimental results showed that Inception-V3 yielded the best results with an average accuracy of 87.2 percent in estimating the severity status of Tuta absoluta in tomato plants. The pre-trained models could also easily identify High Tuta severity status compared to other severity status (Low tuta and No tuta)'
