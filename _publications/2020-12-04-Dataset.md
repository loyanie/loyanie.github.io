The images of tomato leafminer (Tuta absoluta) were taken in in-house plots between August 2018 and May 2019 in Arusha, Tanzania.  Under net-house that were controlled from other others. T.absoluta larvae were inoculated on the commonly grown tomato varieties at the early growth stage (herein, on the second day after transplanting). The images were taken for the first 2 weeks after inoculation. Images captured the canopy of the plants. '

This study was conducted in Tanzania targeting a variety of tomato growers around the country. Two in-house experiments were set up in Arusha and Morogoro regions which are located in the northern and eastern part of the country respectively.The two regions are some of the major areas prone to Tuta absoluta infestation in Tanzania. In each region, we constructed a net house  and then planted healthy tomato seedlings (free from other diseases and pests) considering different factors. On the second day after transplanting, Tuta absoluta was introduced to some randomly selected tomato plants by placing 2 to 8 larvae on top of each plantâ€™s leaves. The pest immediately started to mine the leaves. This process was done under the supervision of an agricultural expert. 

Tomato plant images at early growth stages were collected using a Canon EOS Kiss X7 camera with a resolution of 5184 x 3456 pixels. The images were taken daily for two consecutive weeks after infestation focusing on capturing the top approximately 30 centimetres from the plant since the plant crown is always affected by the pest in the early growth stages of the plant.
